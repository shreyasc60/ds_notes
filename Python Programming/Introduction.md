## Python 3 vs Python 2

Python 3 is much newer, and Python 2 reached "end if life" on January 1, 2020. So, unless you're working on a code which was written a long ago in the past, you're gonna use the latest Python 3. Python is actually a specification of language that can be implemented in many ways.
## Implementations of Python

When people speak of _Python_ they often mean not just the language but also the CPython implementation.

There are various implementations of python:
1. CPython
2. PyPy
3. Jyton
4. IronPython
5. PythonNet

#### CPython[](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/which-python/#cpython "Permalink to this headline")

[CPython](http://www.python.org) is the reference implementation of Python, written in C. It compiles Python code to intermediate bytecode which is then interpreted by a virtual machine. CPython provides the highest level of compatibility with Python packages and C extension modules.
